# InventoryWatch Feedback and Bug üêõ

Thanks for using [InventoryWatch](https://inventorywatch.app)! You can use this repo to report bugs and issues, submit feedback, or discuss feature requests. 

### How do I report a bug?

To create a report, you'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/), which is fast and free to do.

Then, go to the ‚ÄúIssues‚Äù tab at the top of this page, then select ‚ÄúNew Issue‚Äù and fill out the form. Please include as much information as you can, including screenshots and steps to reproduce (if possible!). Polite and kind behaviour is appreciated - we're all just humans trying to do our best :)

### Why do I need to sign up for a Github account?

Github is great, super accessible software that anyone can use. By tracking InventoryWatch feedback and bugs here, we can keep things organized, reduce spam, and link relevant InventoryWatch development directly to the relevant issues in this repo. Give it a shot!

GitHub's an awesome site that's really well-suited for bug tracking. It'll keep things more organized than having bug bug discussions, feature requests, memes, announcement posts, and more all in the subreddit. Having to sign up for an account is super quick though and helps cut down on spam, so it's worth it, trust me! [Sign Up](https://github.com/)
